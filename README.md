# SVM Kernel Comparison: Linear vs Polynomial vs RBF

## Overview

This project demonstrates how the choice of kernel affects the performance and decision boundaries of Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Using a synthetic non-linear dataset, we compare three kernel types—**linear**, **polynomial**, and **RBF (radial basis function)**—through both visualizations and classification metrics.

This tutorial is part of an individual assignment for a postgraduate machine learning module and is intended as an educational tool for those interested in kernel-based classification techniques.

## Objectives

- Explain the role of kernels in SVMs
- Visualize decision boundaries for different kernels
- Evaluate classification performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Provide guidance on practical kernel selection

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/svm-kernel-comparison.git
   cd svm-kernel-comparison
